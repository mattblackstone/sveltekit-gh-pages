            HTML5 introduced the Canvas element which is meant for direct pixel manipulation using Photoshop-like
            effects. A canvas can have a 2D or 3D drawing context. Animation can be acheived by drawing new images to
            the canvas several times per-second. This example uses a Javascript loop to draw particles to the canvas at
            a rate of 30fps. <a href="https://mattblackstone.com/digital-advertising/samsung/galaxy-s10/gamers/970x250/index.html">View ad</a> |

            All modern browsers have basic support CSS 3D. It's a bit convoluted to use, but has a tiny footprint
            compared to more robust Javascript 3D libraries. Although not true 3D, a lot can be acheived through careful
            perspective transformations of 2D elements. <a href="https://mattblackstone.com/digital-advertising/samsung/galaxy-fold/kv-fold/300x600/index.html">View ad</a> |

          <p>
            <a href="https://airbnb.io/lottie/">Lottie</a> is only a few years old but is gaining in popularity. After
            installing a plugin called <a href="https://aescripts.com/bodymovin/">Bodymovin</a> in After Effects,
            animations can be output to a JSON format which can be played back natively on mobile and in a browser using
            the <a href="https://cdnjs.com/libraries/bodymovin">Lottie JS library</a>. Even though Lottie only supports
            a subset of After Effects features (works best with vector content, no Expressions or fancy effects), it
            allows for very high quality animations that compress very well. Lottie animations also allow playback
            control and dispatch events. <a href="https://mattblackstone.com/digital-advertising/samsung/ugtg/screen/970x250/index.html">View ad</a>

            Sprite is a generic term for a small bitmap image (usually one of many images stitched together into one
            large image for better performance). This example uses image sequences stiched together into long strips
            that give the illusion of motion like a film strip. This setup provides granular control for playing
            animations forward or in reverse or dynamically changing the frames per-second.
