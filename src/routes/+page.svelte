            Automated workflows using custom scripted Google Sheets are extremely effective, but can be overwhelming. A
            well designed front-end view gives much more control over how the data is displayed while still using the
            Google Sheets as the data source. The tech stack includes Google APIs, AWS Lambda, React and Next.js <a

            custom developed solution, new vehicle configurations are pulled dynamically from the MBUSA media server at
            impression time, and cached at the dynamic ad server for future requests.

            Data from abandoned shopping carts on Disney owned properties helps target users with ads designed to

            suggestions relevant to the resorts from their carts. The content changes over time with special offers and
            reminders to book soon. Design systems, automation and extremely flexible HTML templates enabled thousands

          <p>
            A programmatic ad campaign built without the use of a dynamic ad server such as Sizmek or Flashtalking. A
            local Node.js workflow paired with scripted spreadsheets to automate the creation of the hundreds of ad
            versions required circumvented the need for a dynamic ad server. As a result, the media team retained full
            ownership of the performance metrics and the ads were served at a much lower cost. <a
