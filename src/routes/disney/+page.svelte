          <h4>The Problem</h4>
          <p>
            A visit to Walt Disney World is magical, but planning one is not. Millions of potential visitors abandon
            their carts. Most of leisure travelers worry they're not finding the best price or making the best decisions
            while booking a trip. More than half of cart abandoners felt the magic was lost during the planning process.

          <h4>The Plan</h4>
          <p>
            Make planning the experience feel more like the trip itself. Most cart abandoners would be more likely to
            book if the planning process felt "magical". Analyze data from various sources to determine who to talk to,
            and how. Create relevant content that supports the unique needs and mindsets of different people at
            different times. Distribute personalized content dynamically as a series of touchpoints that create a unique
            journey.

          <h4>Execution</h4>
          <p>
            Creating highly personalized and relevant messaging requires massive amounts of content. Templates and style
            guides normalized all the visuals. Custom scripted Google Sheets helped automate the process of going from
            client approval to production-ready assets in multiple formats. Flexible HTML templates allowed enough
            creative leeway so that the end result didn't look "templated".
